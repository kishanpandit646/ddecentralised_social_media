## Project Title
**Decentralized Social Media**

---

## Project Description
This project aims to build a fully decentralized social media platform where users have complete control over their data. Unlike traditional social media platforms, this system ensures that user data is not owned or controlled by any central authority. The platform leverages blockchain technology to provide transparency, security, and user autonomy.

---

## Project Vision
Our vision is to create a social media ecosystem that prioritizes user privacy, data ownership, and freedom of expression. By decentralizing the platform, we aim to eliminate the risks of data breaches, censorship, and monopolistic control by corporations.

---

## Future Scope
1. **Integration with IPFS**: Store user data on the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) for enhanced decentralization.
2. **Tokenized Rewards**: Introduce a token economy to reward users for creating and sharing content.
3. **Decentralized Identity**: Implement a decentralized identity system to allow users to manage their digital identities securely.
4. **Community Governance**: Enable users to participate in platform governance through a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO).

---

## Key Features
1. **User-Controlled Data**: Users have full ownership and control over their data.
2. **Transparency**: All transactions and interactions are recorded on the blockchain, ensuring transparency.
3. **Censorship Resistance**: Decentralization ensures that no single entity can censor content.
4. **Security**: Blockchain technology provides a secure environment for user interactions.
5. **Open Source**: The platform is open source, allowing for community contributions and improvements.
